        <h3>Design Process:</h3>
        <p>The design process for me was essentially figuring out how to create this game step by step.</p>
        <p>I realized early on that utilizing object states were going to be extremely useful, and essentially took it from there!</p>
        <p>I created states for each phase of the flower growing process (falling, expanding, growing, blossoming, etc.)</p>
        <p>and also created functions that would be called in those specific states (eg. drop, rotate, grow), to display the growth changes.</p>
